		<p>
		New features in SoapUI 2.5.1 are Projects containing TestSuites/TestCases for validating <a href="http://www.wstf.org/" >WSTF scenario </a> 
		implementation. Current TetsRequest are configured for soap1.1 version of WSTF scenarios part( see the Interface property of 
		particular TestRequest). This can be reverted to soap1.2 version by changing the operation of the request to soap12binding which already
		is included in Projects as one of the interfaces. </p>
        <p>Two different projects, for two scenarios are added</p>

		<subsection name="WSTF SC003 Project">
		<p>This project is testing properly implemented WS-Addressing scenarios(see WS-Addressing in UserGuide).Project is divided into TestSteps 
		and TestCases as specified in <a href="http://www.wstf.org/docs/scenarios/sc003/sc003.xml#sec3">
		WSTF specification.</a> For "Sync" tests TestCases consist of only one TestRequest which have properly defined assertions in order to validate 
		given scenario. But, for "Async" tests, due to the need to test response on a new connection there has to be a property named publicIp defined 
		on a Project level and set to publicly accessible IP address. Main TestRequest has "wsa:replyTo"(for example for "1.4 Async Echo + Wsa TestCase") 
		or "wsa:FaultTo" (1.6 Async Faulting Echo + Wsa TestCase) set to this "publicIp" property indicating where to redirect the response.  
		</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/asyncTestCase_wsaInspector.gif" alt="Async TestCase - WS-A inspector setting"/></p>
		<p>Also there are more TestSteps defined for this kind of TestCases. Last TestStep in every "Async" test is a MockResponse TestStep which have appropriate 
		assertions defined. It is important for MockResponse to have properly set "Handle Response", "Handle Fault" and "Start Step" set to 
		previous TestRequest.</p>
