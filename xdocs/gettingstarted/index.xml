    <body>
		<section name="Getting Started with soapUI">
		<p>Below you'll find a step-by-step guide to creating your first soapUI project with some requests and a TestCase. The
		sample will use the amazon.com web service</p>
		
		 <p>Although soapUI should be easy to get started with, you will need to have a good grasp of the following 
		 concepts and technologies to get the most out of soapUI's functionality.</p>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>WSDL - basic concepts (services, ports, bindings, port types), relation to xml-schema</li>
		 	<li>SOAP - basic concepts, relation to WSDL (bindings, etc), different encoding types (soap-encoded/literal) and 
		 	message styles (document/rpc)</li>
		 	<li>XML and related technologies - XPath, XML Schema, namespaces, etc</li>
		 </ul>
		
		 <p>You can find most specifications at <a target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org">W3C Web Site</a> and tutorials
		 at several sites, for example <a target="_new" href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools Web Site</a> and
		 <a target="_new" href="http://www.zvon.org/o_html/group_web_services.html">zvon.org Web Site</a>.</p>
		
		<subsection name="Install and Run soapUI">
		
		<p>Install and Run soapUI in one of the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>By launching the latest version with Java WebStart from this sites' <a href="../index.html">top page</a></li>
		<li>By downloading and installing soapUI using the windows installer from 
		<a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=136013">SourceForge soapUI Web Site</a>, which 
		includes the required 1.6 JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Use the installer if you are unsure about your systems Java 
		installation or if you want startup menu icons and an uninstaller.</li>
		<li>By downloading the binary distribution from 
		<a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=136013">SourceForge</a> 
		(for example "soapui-1.5-bin.zip") and unzipping it manually and running the included bin\soapui.bat (or .sh) 
		script (you	will need Java in your path).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In any case, soapUI should start and display an empty Workspace to get started with.</p>

		 <subsection name="Create or Import a Web Service testing project">
		 
		<columns><column><div>
		Now that you're up and running, get going by creating your first project.</div>
		<ul>
		<li>Right click on the workspace node in the left navigation pane and select "New WSDL Project"</li>
		<li>You will be prompted for a project name and then for a local file where the project should be saved</li>
		<li>If all is OK an empty project will be created in the workspace</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have downloaded the offline version, a sample project is included in the root folder; select 
		"Import Project" instead and browse to the sample-soapui-project.xml file.</p>

		 <subsection name="Add a WSDL to create tests from">
		<columns><column><div>
		Now that you have a project you can start adding Interfaces (i.e. Web Service PortTypes) to it.</div>
		<ul>
		<li>Right click on the project node and select "Add WSDL from URL"</li>
		<li>You will be prompted for the URL to the Interfaces WSDL; enter 
		<pre>http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/<br/>AWSECommerceService.wsdl</pre> 
		to add the amazon web service and select "Ok".</li>
		<li>soapUI will prompt you if you want to create default requests for each operation, simply select "Yes"</li>
		<li>soapUI will now add the SOAP/Http Binding for the amazon "AWSECommerceServicePortType" PortType to your project
		and create nodes for each operation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Read more about interfaces in the <a href="userguide/interfaces/index.html">soapUI User Guide</a></p>

		 </subsection>
		 
		 <subsection name="Try some Web Service requests">
		<columns><column><div>
		Now that you have added the amazon Web Service you can start playing around with some requests. 
		When you added the interface in the previous step soapUI created default requests for each operation in 
		accordance with their WSDL and Schema definition.</div>
		<ul>
		<li>Expand the Interface node and any Operation node under it, you should see the created "Request 1".</li>
		<li>Double-click the request node to open the request editor in the right part of soapUI (see image below)</li>
		<li>The request editor is divided into 3 parts:
			<ul>
				<li>A toolbar at the top with a number of request related actions/options</li>
		   		<li>A request area to the left</li>
		   		<li>A response area to the right</li>
		   </ul>
		   </li>
		   <li>The default request created by soapUI will have "?" for each value that needs to be supplied in the request, 
		   replace or remove any values as required and post request by pressing the left-most toolbar button (a green arrow)</li>
		   <li>The request will run in the background and its response will be displayed in the right editor</li>
		</ul>
