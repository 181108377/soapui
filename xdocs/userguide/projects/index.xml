		<section name="Web Service test projects">
	  	 <p>Any number of projects can be created in the current soapUI Workspace, either by creating new ones (see below)
	  	 or importing existing ones... A soapUI Project contains the following items in the Navigator:</p>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>A number of Interfaces each corresponding to a SOAP/HTTP Binding for a defined PortType</li>
		 	<li>A number of TestSuites containing TestCases for these Interfaces' Operations</li>
		 	<li>A number of MockServices containing Mock implementations of these Interfaces' Operations</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>soapUI projects are saved in a self contained xml file upon creation (as described above).
		 This file can be safely moved around, checked into CVS, sent by email, etc. It only has file-system 
		 references if an interface/WSDL has been imported from a local file (not recommended due to this limitation) 
		 or if referenced attachments or inline files are used <a href="../attachments.html">(see Attachments)</a>. 
		 When obtaining an existing soapUI project file, this can be added to the current workspace with the 
		 "Import Project" action on the Workspace popup menu.</p>
		 
		 <p>Internally, soapUI abstracts the actual nature of projects and their contained interfaces, tests, etc... 
		  opening the possiblity of support for other service definitions or protocols than WSDL / SOAP (check out 
		 the <code>com.eviware.soapui.model</code> package). Currently though, the only implementation for
		 these interfaces is for WSDL 1.1 and the SOAP/HTTP binding (as required by Basic Profile 1.0). Therefore, 
		 all actions and functionality described will be in regard to this implementation.</p>
		
		 <subsection name="Creating a SoapUI Projects">
		 <p>Selecting the New SoapUI Project option from the Workspace Menu opens this dialog which prompts for:
		 <ul>
		 	<li>A name for the project is required</li>
		 	<li>An optional initial WSDL/WADL to import into the project (either file or URL)</li>
		 	<li>An option to create default requests when specifying an initial WSDL</li>
		 	<li>An option to create TestSuite for specified WSDL or WADL</li>
		 	<li>An option to create Web Service Simulation of the imported WSDL</li>
		 	<li>An option to open dialog to create REST service</li>
		 	<li>An option to store all file paths in project relatively to project file(requires save)</li>
		 </ul>
		</p>
		<p align="center">@TODO@change the screen shot<img src="images/new_wsdl_project.gif" alt="Creating a new Web Service test project from WSDL in soapUI"/></p>
		<p>Once specified, soapUI will prompt for a filename to which the project is to be saved (defaults to 
	 	<code>&lt;project-name&gt;-soapui-project.xml</code>). Put this file anywhere you want, the file
	 	is a regular XML file and can be checked into SCM systems and edited with any XML editor.</p>
		</subsection>
		
		 <subsection name="Remote Test Projects">
		 <columns><column><div>
		 soapUI 1.7.6 and following can handle remote project files over http(s) in read only mode (basic authentication is supported). 
		 When importing, the URL to the project file is saved in the workspace and can be closed, opened, or reloaded 
		 as usual.</div>
		 <p>Remote projects are always closed at startup and marked with a light blue icon in the navigator.</p>
		 </column><column>
			<img src="images/remote_project.gif" border="0" alt="A remote project in soapUI"/>
			</column></columns>
	 	 <p>This opens for a number of possibilities:</p>
		 <ul>
		 <li>Projects can easily be distributed to clients without the requirement to download updates, 
		 for example for testing or demonstration purposes.</li>
		 <li>The command line TestRunners also accept http url project files, allowing for centralized 
		 storage of project files even if they are run in a distributed testing environment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Remote projects can be modified as normal projects, but soapUI will not prompt to save them on exit or close.
		If changes to a remote project need to be saved, use the "Save as" Project Menu action which prompts to 
		save the project locally, transforming it to a regular file based project.</p>

		 <subsection name="Test Project Actions">
		<columns><column><div>
		 The following actions are available from the project nodes' right-button menu:		 
		 <ul>
		 @TODO@everything is listed, just check options explanations
		 <li><b>Show Project View</b> - Prompts for a WSDL URL that will be parsed and imported accordingly</li>
		 <li><b>Add WSDL </b> - Prompts for a WSDL (either URL or file path) that will be parsed and imported accordingly</li>
		 <li><b>Add WADL</b> - Prompts for a WADL (either URL or file path) that will be parsed and imported accordingly</li>
		 <li><b>New REST Service</b> - Adds a new <a href="../rest/index.html">REST Service</a> to this project</li>
		 <li><b>Launch TestRunner</b> - Opens the dialog for launching the 
		 <a href="../commandline/functional.html#Launch_Dialog">Command Line TestRunner</a></li>
		 <li><b>Launch LoadTestRunner</b> - Opens the dialog for launching the 
		 <a href="../commandline/loadtest.html#Launch_Dialog">Command Line LoadTestRunner</a></li>

		 The "Details" tab shown in the bottom-left shows the following values when the workspace node is selected in 
		 the navigation tree
		 <ul>

		 (see <a href="../interfaces/index.html#Caching_Definitions">Caching Definitions</a>). 
		 This overrides the global "Cache WSDLs" setting under the WSDL Preferences settings tab</li>

		 <subsection name="Project View">
		<p>When double clicking a project you will get the Project View. The purpose of the project view is giving 
		you a work area for project related functionality.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Project view consist of a number of tabs available at the top and a number of inspectors available at the 
		bottom of the project view. The inspectors are context sensitive and will change based on which tab you choose.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Tabs are as follows:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Overview Tab</b> The overview tab gives you an quick overview of your project as well as general project metrics such as the number of TestSteps the project contains.<a href="projectview.html">Read More</a></li>
		<li><b>Project Coverage Tab (Pro Only)</b> Project Coverage allows you to see how much of the interfaces contained in the project that is being covered by tests. This functionality will make you development process more efficient and will increase Test Quality considerably.<a href="coverage.html">Read More</a></li>
		<li><b>Project Requirements Tab  (Pro Only)</b> The Project Requirements tab is an easy way of managing test requirements in soapUI.<a href="requirements.html">Read More</a></li>
